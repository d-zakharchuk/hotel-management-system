# Hotel Management System
ver. 2017.7.18.1526

This app is developed for hotel reception and administration, providing them an opportunity to manage clientsâ€™ base, booking state of rooms and hotel income info.

There are two modes: Reception Mode and Admin (SuperUser) Mode.

Reception Mode:
- registering clients, filling their name, date of birth, phone and country.
- booking a room based on room type, room number and check in date.
- customers can also order some services offered by the hotel.
- creating an invoice when checking out the clients (invoice can be saved as HTML file for future printing).
- viewing hotel income info. A chart will help to analyze the growth dynamics of income of the last year.

Admin (SuperUser) Mode:
- modifying room types which involves: maximum number of people allowed to stay in a room, pricing preferences, room area.
- modifying services (service name and price).
- deleting income info.
- changing login data.

There are two versions: the first one with SQL, another one uses Entity Framework technology.

Database issues:
Copy database file Hotel.mdf to location you prefer.
For SQL version, find file /SQL-version/HotelManagement/bin/Debug/DatabasePath.txt and type the path to your database.
For Entity Framework version, find the following two files:
1) /EF-version/HotelDataEF/App.config
2) /EF-version/HotelManagement/App.config

Go to connection strings section (first one: string #8, second one: string #11) and replace the initial database file path with your own where your database is located.
